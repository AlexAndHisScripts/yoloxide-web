## What it does
Yoloxide-web is a online yolol editor written in react with redux leveraging the [yoloxide interpreter](https://github.com/Jerald/yoloxide). It is designed to simulate in game device networks so that you can prototype your code with zero set up.

## Where it is
Currently yoloxide-web is in alpha as we are still building  its functionality.
